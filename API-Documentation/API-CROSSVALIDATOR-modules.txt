Functions		#

				1.#   kcrossvalidate(STRING folder_dir, INT k, BOOLEAN split_to_folder)
				#   performs kcrossvalidation on image files found in a given folder directory.
				#   Either the image files will be partitioned into 2 separate folders OR 2 text files listing their group members is created.
				#   This operation is done depending on the BOOLEAN split_to_folder. The function returns NONE.
				#
				#
				#   <Input>
				#       required STRING folder_dir | The directory path containing all image samples
				#       optional INT k | The k value of k cross validation. The number of test samples generated will be equal to N // k
				#       optional BOOLEAN split_to_folder | The decision of the images in the directory should be moved to separate folders of 'test' and 'train' respectively.
				#                                          TRUE = File list not generated. Image files moved to separated folders.
				#                                          FALSE = File list is generated into 2 text files. {k}folds_train_list.txt and {k}folds_test_list.txt. Image files are not moved.
				#
				#   <Output>
				#       NONE

				2.#   getFiles(STRING folder_dir)
				#   gets a list of filenames without their format (like .jpg) in a given folder directory.
				#
				#
				#   <Input>
				#       required STRING folder_dir | The directory path containing image files.
				#   <Output>
				#       1D-ARRAY<String> filelist | A list of filenames without format tags.

				3.#   generateTrainIndex(INT total_files, INT k)
				#   given the total number of files and the k value of the k-cross validation scheme, generates at random,
				#   the index of files targetted to be test files. Index are distributed between each partition.
				#
				#
				#   <Input>
				#       required INT total_files | The total number of files.
				#       required INT k | k value of the cross validation scheme.
				#   <Output>
				#       1D-ARRAY<Int> train_sample_indexes | The list of index of train files. (The values are indexed across the entire sample)
